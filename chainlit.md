# Welcome to MultiModalRAG! 🚀🤖

Hello, Developer! 👋 This application leverages a **MultiModal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to handle both **text** and **image** data. Get ready to explore a new dimension in AI-driven solutions!

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Text and Image Retrieval**: We seamlessly retrieve and combine relevant **textual** and **visual** content from your dataset.
2. **Fusion for Response Generation**: Our pipeline fuses this text and image data to deliver richer, context-aware answers.
3. **Voice Input** *(Optional)*: Record your voice to ask questions, and our system will transcribe and process your query!

## Useful Links 🔗
